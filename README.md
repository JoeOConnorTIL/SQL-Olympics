In this SQL Olympics challenge I have been trying to further familiarise myself with SQL. This challenge requires uploading data to a database, followed by rearranging the data into fact and dimension tables in a star schema. This has enabled me to practice creating and dropping tables, assigning unique IDs to these tables and adding primary and secondary keys to relate the tables to each other.
